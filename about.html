    made by frank dill. It was made in 2016 but the first videos were not uploaded until
2021. The channel was first called S Dill and is still called that but there is plans to call it
xXfaddle919Xx. In the beginning the YouTube channel made alot of random videos that got anywhere from hundreds
of views to zero views. Over the years the channel evolved into a comity skit channel and a review channel.
